// This is a central class to encapsulate most of the logic in playing a round of 
// Roshambo and calculating the winner.  I pulled it out of the view controller
// since Roshambo is being updated with another view controller to display the
// history.
//
// It could probably be cleaned up a bit more.  I went back and forth on whether I
// should define the PlayType enum in the class or external to the class, as it is now.
